<h2>- Existing System:</h2>
<p>The problems faced in the existing system are that people have to visit 
the hospital at least once to check the doctor’s availability or confirm 
over phone call whether the doctor is available or not. For the 
appointments, yet once again they have to visit the hospitals and wait 
in long queues before they reach the counter and then pay for doctor’s 
appointment. And then on top of it, they have to wait for their turns 
before they can see their medical practitioner.</p>
<h2>- Proposed Solution:</h2>
<p>A website comprising of an online doctor appointment booking system 
so that people make online bookings which will be hassle-free and save 
their time which they have to spend waiting in long queues before 
making appointments and before getting to meet the doctor they have 
taken appointment for.</p> 
<h2>- Main Idea:</h2>
<p>The Online Doctor Appointment Booking System is a simple project 
developed using PHP, JavaScript, and CSS. The project consists of an 
admin and a user. The role of the admin is an important one that is 
managing schedules, patient records, appointment time, treatment 
facilities etc. The user will visit the website and register for 
appointment. The appointments for each doctor will be available on 
the day the doctor will be consulting their patients.</p>
